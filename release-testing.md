## The second heading (two or more options)

If you have clause options in a contract, use three hashes in a row (as you see in the symbols below) to make sure that the system recognises them.

This section, between the heading and the clause options, allows you to explain the options below.  Tell the people who will use template what they should think about when they choose between the two options below.

### This is option 1 under the second heading of the Agreement.

This is the clause text for option 1 under heading 2 of the Agreement.  The word Agreement is highlighted because at the end of this document, it's listed as a defined word.

### This is option 2 under the second heading of the Agreement.

This is the clause text for option 2 under heading 2 of the Agreement between Buyer and Seller.  This is using the Second Definition - and now for a Three Word Definition.
